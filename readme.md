A command-line tool for processing deepest-lore schemas and data.

All runs include a pass by [@deepest-lore/validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepest-lore/validator).

Warnings will be printed but do not count as an error by default.

## Parameters

### `--fs-import {path}`

The base directory from which to import; runs once then stops.  Exits on error
and returns a non-zero exit code.

Uses [@deepest-lore/fs-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepest-lore/fs-import).

### `--fs-import-watch {path}`

The base directory from which to import; runs once then waits for changes before
running again until terminated by the user.  Aborts run but does not exit on
error.

Uses [@deepest-lore/fs-import-watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepest-lore/fs-import-watch).

### `--warnings-as-errors`

When present, any warnings generated by
[@deepest-lore/validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepest-lore/validator)
will instead be treated as errors.  The standard error handling logic will then
apply.

### `--html-export {path}`

The base directory to which to export; this will be deleted and replaced with a
new directory containing the exported HTML.
